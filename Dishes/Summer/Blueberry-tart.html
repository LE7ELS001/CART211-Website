                        inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.

                        Blueberry Tart may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Garbage Can outside the
                        saloon, or in the
                        Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. One Blueberry Tart may be received from opening a Mystery Box.

                <strong> THE CORNMEAL CRUST: In a large bowl, combine the
                    butter and sugar. Use an electric hand mixer on medium
                    speed to blend until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add
                    the egg yolk and blend until smooth.
                    Add the flour, cornmeal, and ½ teaspoon salt and mix on
                    low speed until combined and crumbly. Add the milk and
                    mix until the dough starts to form large crumbles. The
                    dough is ready when you can squeeze some of it in the
                    palm of your hand and it holds together.
                    Use your hands to form the mixture into a mostly smooth
                    dough, then transfer it to a 9-inch (23 cm) tart pan with a
                    removable bottom. Press the dough evenly into the
                    bottom and up the sides of the pan, getting it as close to
                    ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick as possible. Use the bottom of a
                    drinking glass or a measuring cup to help get the crust
                    nice and even. Trim any excess dough from the edges of
                    the tart pan. Prick the bottom of the crust all over with a
                    fork, then chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour
                    and up to overnight.
                    Set a baking sheet on the lowest rack of the oven and
                    preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). Line the tart crust with
                    parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill to the very top of
                    the crust with dry rice or dried beans.
                    Place the tart pan on the baking sheet and bake until the
                    edges of the crust start to feel dry and set, 20 to 25
                    minutes. Carefully remove the parchment paper and the
                    rice. Return the crust to the oven and continue to bake
                    until the edges are golden brown and the dough is cooked
                    through, about 15 minutes, rotating the baking sheet once
                    after 8 minutes.
                    Remove the crust from the oven and cool completely on
                    the baking sheet. Reduce the oven temperature to 325ºF
                    (165ºC).
                    FOR THE BLUEBERRY CURD: In a large saucepan over medium
                    heat, combine the 8 ounces (225 g) blueberries and the
                    water and simmer until most of the blueberries have burst
                    and released their juices, about 8 minutes, stirring
                    occasionally and smashing some of the juicy berries
                    against the side of the saucepan.
                    Strain the blueberry mixture through a fine-mesh strainer
                    into a large glass bowl, pressing down on the berries to
                    get every bit of juice out. Be sure to scrape off any pulp
                    that is stuck to the back of the strainer; only the skin of the
                    berries should be left in the strainer once you are done.
                    Rinse out the strainer and place over a medium bowl.
                    (You will use this later to strain the finished curd.)
                    Wash out the saucepan and fill it with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of
                    water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat,
                    then lower the heat to medium (the water should be
                    actively simmering).
                    To the glass bowl with the strained blueberry mixture add
                    the sugar, ⅓ cup (80 ml) lemon juice, the cornstarch, and
                    ¼ teaspoon salt. Whisk until smooth. Add the eggs and
                    egg yolks and whisk again until smooth. Put the bowl on
                    top of the saucepan of simmering water and cook,
                    whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to a
                    consistency similar to a creamy berry milkshake, about 20
                    minutes. (Taste the curd to ensure that there is no longer
                    any chalkiness from the cornstarch; if there is, continue to
                    cook the curd for a couple additional minutes, then taste
                    the curd again.)
                    Place the bowl on a kitchen towel or wipe the bottom of
                    the bowl of any water and place it on a trivet, if possible.
                    Slowly whisk in the butter, a couple of cubes at a time,
                    whisking well after each addition, then whisk in the
                    blueberry preserves until smooth. Strain the curd through
                    the strainer into the bowl.</strong>
